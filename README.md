# Georgia Elections
*Information on federal elections in Georgia regarding registered voter demographics and election outcomes.*

### Should the result of Georgia voters favoring the Democratic candidates in 2020 have come as a surprise to the country? Is this likely to be repeated in subsequent federal elections?

Georgia stole the national spotlight in the United States during a contentious federal election in 2020, prompting many to cry foul about the results.

While the Georgia legislature has responded to supposed voter fraud by proposing new bills that limit the ability to vote in some scope, many others have claimed that this result is actually more representative of the underlying identity of the state. They explain that a history of voter suppression throughout targeted areas and communities has led to election results that are not representative of the state's population.

Our data consider objectively both the demographic changes in registered voters and the results of elections from 2008 to 2021 in the state of Georgia.
